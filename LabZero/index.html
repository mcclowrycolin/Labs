    <h2>Journalism</h2>
    <p>My dream job would be to cover the Olympics</p>
    <h3>Junior</h3>
    <p>When I leave this class I hope that I will have a great base of knewledge for Web Design. I hope I will be motivated to continue to learn about Web Design after this class is over.</p>
    <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
    <p>My favorite things are exercise and spending time with my family. I get my exercise fix from competing for the track team on campus. I have a twin brother named Payton and a younger brother named gavin. They go to the same University in Chicago so I oftentimes look for excuses to visit.</p>
