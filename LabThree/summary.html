       <p>Gorilla's are a feared species. They are one of the animals that share the most DNA with humans, yet they are much stronger than us. They are smart, have opposable thumbs, and walk around on two legs. Fear of these animals has caused incidences such as the death of Harambe, a beloved Gorilla in the Cincinnati Zoo. Can these misunderstood creatures hold their own against a Grizzly Bear? </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Answer: Nope.</h3>
        <p>Grizzly Bear's are quite possibly the scariest animal on earth. They are huuuuuge, can run incredibly fast, and can climb trees. Not to mention they have razor sharp claws and teeth. If you need a visual, watch Leonardo Dicaprio's film: The Revenent. Not even he could deafeat this apex predator.</p>
